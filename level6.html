            <p>Association hereby authorizes and appoints “Rep” as an independent contractor, to:</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <br>
                <li>Recruit and obtain applications for membership in the Association. Association
                    benefits include, but are not limited to: alternative medicine, dental, discount Rx

                    programs issued by any insurance company (“Company”) under contract with the
                    Association.
                </li><br>
                <li>Collect from applicants the initial contribution, the application fee and any other
                    amounts or fees required in connection with the application (the Fees) to be
                    tendered with such applications, and</li><br>
                <li>Forward all completed applications and corresponding initial contribution and

            </ol>
            <p>Rep shall be free to exercise his or her own judgement as to the persons from
                whomever the rep will solicit applications for membership and as to the time, place,
                methods and means of each solicitation, subject, however, to the provisions of this
                contract. Association and Rep expressly agree the relationship between Association
                and Rep shall be that of an independent contractor, and nothing herein shall be
                construed to create the relationship of principal/agent or employer/employee.</p><br>

            <p>Rep shall have no authority to make, alter, or discharge contracts for the Association or
                Company; nor to waive forfeitures, grant permits, revise pricing for special risks, make
                endorsements or bind Association or Company in any way. Rep shall have no authority
                to incur any expense of liability on behalf of the Association or Company, and neither
                Association nor Company shall be liable for any expenses incurred by Rep in connection
                with Rep’s solicitation of business. Rep shall have no authority to make statements,
                promises or representations to an applicant that any coverage will be issued or insured
                with a specific effective date.
            </p><br>
            <p>Rep is not permitted to contact any third party administrator or third party vendor
                contracted by the Association or insurance carrier contracted with the Association.
                Association shall periodically issue instructions and procedures of a general nature
                concerning the performance of this contract and the relationship created between the parties. Rep shall
                abide by and carry out all such instructions and procedures.
                Association may also, from time to time, prescribe rules respecting the requirements for
                eligibility of applicants for coverage (not interfering with the freedom of action of Rep),
                which rules shall be observed and followed by Rep. Association instructions and
                procedures may be changed, or altered by Association in its sole discretion, at any time.</p><br>
            <p>Association and Company shall use best efforts to process applications solicited and
                submitted by Rep, but under no circumstances shall Association or Company have any
                liability for any failure or delay in processing any applications or for declining to issue a
                policy. With respect to any such policies as may in fact be issued, Association or
                Company shall have no obligation to Rep or any other person to issue any such policy or
                to do so with any specific effective date. It is understood that the effective date of any
                such policy shall be determined by Association or Company at its discretion.
            </p><br>
            <p>By execution of this contract Rep hereby releases Association, Company and all other
                individuals or entities from any and all claims, demands, or causes of action of whatever
                nature, which may be asserted against Association, Company or other individual or
                entity, and which arise from Rep’s appointments, investigation into the Rep’s
                background, the furnishing of information by an individual or entity pursuant to such
                investigation, or the monitoring of Rep’s business transactions. Rep understands and
                acknowledges that Association or Company may, at its sole discretion, decline to
                appoint Rep. Rep hereby indemnifies and holds harmless and will reimburse
                Association for any and all expenses, liabilities and damages, including all attorney fees
                and court costs, that may be incurred as a result of any action or inaction on the part of
                the Rep.</p><br>

            <p>Except as otherwise herein provided, Rep shall be entitled to and shall receive from
                Association compensation for Rep’s services fees based on contributions received by
                Association on memberships issued on approved applications secured by Rep. Such

                schedule; provided, however, that any such modification shall be effective only for
                applications received by the Association after the effective date of such modification.</p><br>

                Agreement or at any time thereafter except as may be required in the performance of
                this Agreement or any time thereafter. If there is any breach of this provision, then any
                such fees that may be payable to Rep shall be forfeited as liquidated damages</p><br>
            <p>Unless Rep is a licensed insurance agent or licensed insurance agency, for a two-year
                period following termination of this contract Rep is specifically prohibited from:</p><br>
